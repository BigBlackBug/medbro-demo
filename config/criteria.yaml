history_taking: "History Taking. EVALUATE STRICTLY. 5 points are awarded ONLY if the doctor elicited ALL details using the SOCRATES system (or equivalents), collected allergy history, medication history, family history, and chronic conditions. If the doctor did not ask about allergies or current medications — score no higher than 3."
clinical_reasoning: "Clinical Reasoning. Evaluate the logic of diagnosis. 5 points — doctor voiced hypotheses, ruled out red flags, and justified the diagnosis with history data. If the diagnosis is made without sufficient grounds or obvious differential diagnoses are missed — score is reduced to 2-3."
communication: "Communication and Empathy. 5 points — doctor is active, listens, does not interrupt, shows empathy, consultation structure is clear. Use of complex terms without explanation, rudeness, ignoring patient fears — grounds to lower score to 3 and below."
safety: "Prescription Safety. CRITICAL POINT. Mandatory check for allergies and drug interactions. If the doctor prescribed a medication without asking about allergies — score 1. If an unsafe combination is prescribed — score 1."
treatment_appropriateness: "Treatment Appropriateness (EBM). Adherence to evidence-based medicine principles. If medications with unproven efficacy are prescribed (homeopathy, immunomodulators without indications, nootropics 'just in case') — score no higher than 2. Treatment must be adequate for the diagnosis."
diagnostic_strategy: "Diagnostic Strategy. Justification of prescribed tests. 5 points — only necessary tests to confirm hypotheses are prescribed. Overdiagnosis (prescribing 'everything' as a checkup) or lack of necessary investigations — score 3 or lower."
patient_education: "Patient Education. The doctor must explain the essence of the disease, prognosis, and reasons for prescriptions in accessible language. 5 points — if the doctor ensured the patient understood everything (teach-back technique) and answered questions. Dry listing of prescriptions — score 2-3."
follow_up_planning: "Follow-up Planning and 'Red Flags'. The doctor MUST articulate which symptoms are considered dangerous and require urgent ambulance call/repeat appointment. Absence of instructions on alarming symptoms — score no higher than 3."
professionalism: "Professionalism and Ethics. Maintaining boundaries, respectful attitude, absence of judgment (victim blaming). Any ethical violations (familiarity, judgmental statements) — score 1-2."
